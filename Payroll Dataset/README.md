🧾 Project Title

Employee Payroll Data Cleaning and Analysis

📘 Project Summary

This project focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing an Employee Payroll Dataset to understand salary structures, departmental costs, and payroll distributions.

The dataset includes columns for base salary, bonuses, taxes, and deductions for employees across departments. The main objectives are to ensure data accuracy, standardize formats, and extract insights into salary composition and departmental expense trends.

By completing this project, I demonstrate skills in data entry validation, preprocessing, descriptive analysis, and visualization — all essential for finance or HR analytics roles.

🗂️ Dataset Overview

Simulated dataset with the following columns:

Column Name	Description
Employee_ID	Unique identifier for each employee
Name	Employee’s full name
Department	Department name (e.g., Finance, IT, HR, Marketing)
Position	Job title or role
Base_Salary	Basic monthly salary before bonuses or deductions
Bonus	Additional pay based on performance
Tax	Tax amount deducted from the gross salary
Deductions	Other deductions (insurance, loans, etc.)
Net_Pay	Final take-home salary (Base + Bonus - Tax - Deductions)
Pay_Date	Date of payroll

💡 You can easily create this dataset manually (in Excel) or simulate it using Python (pandas + random data generator).

🔍 Process
1. Data Understanding

Loaded the dataset into Excel / Python.

Reviewed column headers for consistency.

Checked data types and identified formatting issues (e.g., salary stored as text or with symbols).

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed unwanted symbols like $, commas, and extra spaces.

Converted all salary-related columns to numeric data types.

Fixed incorrect or missing values in the Department and Position fields.

Ensured Net Pay = Base Salary + Bonus - Tax - Deductions using formulas or scripts.

Standardized date formats for Pay_Date.

📘 Tools used: Excel / Pandas / Regular Expressions.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated descriptive statistics for all numerical columns (mean, median, min, max).

Identified outliers in salaries and bonuses using box plots.

Checked salary distribution across departments.

Calculated total payroll cost per department.

4. Data Analysis & Pivot Tables

Used Pivot Tables to summarize:

Average Base Salary per Department.

Total Payroll Cost (sum of Net Pay) per Department.

Average Bonus and Tax across positions.

Created computed fields (e.g., Tax-to-Salary ratio).

5. Data Visualization

Bar chart: Total payroll cost by department.

Histogram: Distribution of base salaries.

Box plot: Salary variations across departments.

Pie chart: Department share of total payroll.

Line chart: Monthly payroll trend (if you have Pay_Date).

📊 Tools used: Excel Charts / Matplotlib / Seaborn.

6. Insights & Findings

Examples:

Finance and IT departments have the highest payroll expenses.

Average Net Pay increased steadily from January to June.

Tax deductions make up ~15% of gross salary on average.

Outliers detected in bonuses for Sales department.

7. Reporting

Created a summarized Payroll Dashboard (in Excel or Python visualization).

Documented findings with visuals and explanations.

Uploaded cleaned dataset and project notebook/report to GitHub.
